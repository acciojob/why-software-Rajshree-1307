	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I have always been inquisitive about anything I find compelling, be it studies or extra-curriculum or sports.</p>
	<p>I have set my insights to obtain a challenging position in an organization which provides me ample opportunity to explore & excel in my field through hard work, research, skills and perseverance. Logical problem solving has always appealed to me and this explains my interests
in mathematics, programming and computing in general. I started off with Java and while exploring the world of programming, I started developing my interest in Spring framework and thus I have a flair for backend development.</p>
